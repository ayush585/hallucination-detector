# 🧠 Lightweight Hallucination Detector
**Hackathon Project – IEM HackOsis 2.0**

## 🚀 Problem
Generative AI often produces "hallucinations" – confident but false answers. Detecting them in real-time is crucial for safe AI adoption.

## ✅ Solution
We built a **Lightweight Hallucination Detector** that:
- Retrieves evidence from trusted sources
- Scores answers with a confidence % 
- Provides a short rationale
- (Bonus) Generates **counter-evidence** to stress-test robustness
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard with thresholds + history

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Retrieval Engine + Scoring Engine + Counter-Evidence Module)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (interactive dashboard)
- **Data**: Corpus.json (trusted QA evidence base)
- **Language**: Python 3.10
